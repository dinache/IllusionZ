IllusionZ v.1
This is a game I designed and programmed for CMU's 15-112 Intro to 
Programming 6-week summer course in Python. I created the illusion 
of a 3D environment completely generated by 2D shapes using TKinter.  

The player spawns in a randomly generated world of cubes. 
Some cubes are solid, and some are transparent, represented by 
the dotted lines. Pressing the 'Z' key inverts the world:  
the colors invert, transparent cubes turn solid, and solid 
cubes become transparent. Inverting the world while inside a cube 
will remove it from the game. The objective is to remove as many 
cubes in the time limit, without falling off the map.  

The demo in this version is intended to demonstrate the framework mechanics
of play. The mechanics I designed have potential for a level-based, 
puzzle-solving storyline. 

Below is a video demonstration of the Tutorial, Easy, and Difficult gameplay.
